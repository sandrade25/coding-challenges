verify which of the following types the binary tree is:
- full
    - every node has 0 or 2 children.
- complete
    - every level of the tree is filled except possibly the last level
    - last level has all keys as left as possible
- perfect
    - all internal nodes have two children
    - all leaf (external) nodes are at the same level

- degenerate/pathological
    - every internal node has only one child. Basically a linked list. 

tree can be of multiple types. There are other types of binary trees as well not covered here.
eg: skewed, balanced

## data structures:
- arrays
- queues
- stacks
- trees
- hash tables
- graphs
- binary trees
- tries
  
## algorithms:
- traversals
- divide and conquer
- breadth first search
- depth first search
- quick sort
- insertion sort
- bubble sort
- merge sort

## must have priorities:
- hash tables
- linked lists
- big O notation
- trees (especially binary trees)
- breadth first and depth first search. 
- binary search
- merge sort
- quick sort
- arrays
- recursion
- stacks/queues
-  Questions involving bit manipulation are rare but are encountered from time to time.

# coding-challenges for the sake of studying/practicing for FAANG related tests


## Instructions:
- complete all the worksheets in directory `./worksheets/`
- system uses pytest for validating answers. 
  - run `pytest` to test everything. 
  - run `pytest tests/test_worksheets/test_{worksheet section}.py` to test a specific section you are working on. 
  - you can add `::Test{class name}::test_{function name}` to test a specific function worksheet you are working on.
- if you wish to revert your worksheets back to empty, run: `python revert_worksheets.py`
